# YTL AI Engineer Technical Assessment

This repository contains my responses for the **YTL AI Labs AI Engineer** technical screening.
It includes:

- A Python implementation for LLM JSON validation (**Q1**)
- A high-level architecture design for a knowledge base chatbot system (**Q2**)
- A multilingual summarisation workflow for English and Malay, including preprocessing and safety controls (**Q3**)

---

## ðŸ§  Question 1: `validate_tool_call()`

### ðŸ“„ Description
A Python function that **validates and sanitizes untrusted JSON** generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) according to the schema:

```json
{
  "action": "search" | "answer",
  "q": "non-empty string",        // required if action == "search"
  "k": "integer 1â€“5 (default 3)"  // optional
}
```
## ðŸ§© Question 2: High-Level Knowledge Base System Design

### ðŸ“„ Description
Design a secure, scalable knowledge-base pipeline capable of:

1) Ingesting long documents (PDF, DOCX, OCR)
2) Cleaning and normalizing text
3) Summarizing content in English and Malay
4) Generating vector embeddings for semantic search

## ðŸ“˜ Question 3: Multilingual Summarisation Workflow (English + Malay)

### ðŸ“„ Description
Design a workflow that can summarise long documents into English and Malay, ensuring the output is:

1) faithful to the original content
2) fluent and natural
3) safe (no hallucinations, no added facts)
4) consistent across domains (general, technical, academic)
5) capable of handling code-switching (ENâ€“MY mix)
